# Engineering Profession and Practice
In this project, our team developed a specialized dolly system to help Elissa, who has generalized dystonia, transport heavy objects easily. The main purpose is to relieve stress on the cords in your neck, which can be exacerbated by the physical exertion of carrying heavy items like clothing and groceries. The final product features stair-climbing wheels and an elevated platform, both designed to reduce the amount of strenuous movement Elissa must perform. The dolly is constructed with steel tubing for durability, a plywood platform for lightweight, a heavy-duty scissor jack for lifting and lowering, and is powered by electricity to minimize physical labor. This design greatly eases the challenge of moving heavy items over different terrains, including stairs, and introduces ergonomic advantages by reducing the need to bend and lift to meet Elissa's specific mobility and strength limitations.
